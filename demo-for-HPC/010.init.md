name: "Initializing Chancellor"

Chancellor is a system for transforming markdown into HTML that can be uploaded to the Canvas Learning Management System.
- Chancellor has been developed by Dr Jake Bradford, Associate Professor Gentry White, Dr Matthew McKague, Dan Tran and Jackson Riding

This page has been authored by me (David Lovell) to demonstrate key elements of Chancellor to Kate Stacey, Vicki Thomson and Craig Windell.
- I'm hoping that the recording of this demonstration will be useful to others.

# Before this demo has begun, I have...

This demonstration is not starting from scratch. I have already set up things so that I can "cut to the chase" and show how I use Chancellor in practice. 

## ...set up Canvas

- [A Canvas site](https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/10245) that I can write to
- [A Canvas API](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-in-my-user-account/ta-p/615312) token that enables me to interact with QUT's Canvas instance via the [Canvas LMS API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html)

## ...installed Chancellor

...but not the latest versionâ€”some things will be different with that.

## ...got my tools for authoring and version control

- VScode (for authoring), with a `bash` command line interface (for running Chancellor from the command line)
- `git` (for version control) with [this github repository](https://github.com/DavidRLovell/Chancellor-sandpit-public.git)

## ...cloned my github repo

I have cloned [this github repository](https://github.com/DavidRLovell/Chancellor-sandpit-public.git)
and set up various files and folders as shown in this screenshot from VScode:

## ...written some helper scripts
I have written a couple of shell scripts that I use to make running Chancellor a breeze.

### `chad`: short for "Chancellor add" 
I use this when I want to add a new file for Chancellor to keep track of and deploy to Canvas

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <path to markdown file(s)> <name of Canvas module>"
    echo "This \"Chancellor add\" script tells Chancellor to track the markdown file(s) and add them to the specified module in Canvas."
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: '$1' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

markdown_files="$1"
module_name="$2"

chancellor page              --track    "$markdown_files"                 # Track the markdown file(s)
chancellor page              --add-page "$markdown_files" "$module_name"  # Add the markdown file(s) to the specified module
chancellor run canvas-deploy --targets  "$markdown_files"                 # Deploy the changes to Canvas
```


### `chup`: short for "Chancellor update" 
I use this when I want to add a new file for Chancellor to keep track of and deploy to Canvas

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "-h" || "$1" == "-help" || "$1" == "--help" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 [markdown file(s)]"
    echo "Deploys specified markdown file(s) to Canvas using Chancellor."
    echo "If no files are specified, deploys all tracked files."
    exit 0
fi

if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
    chancellor run canvas-deploy                    # Deploy all tracked files to Canvas
else
    chancellor run canvas-deploy --targets "$@"     # Deploy specified markdown file(s) to Canvas
fi

```
